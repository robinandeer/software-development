    <p>Everything written on this site is orginial content. The premiss should always be based on personal experience. A technique that has worked wonders for you and others. You should have something orginial to say about it. If there's already a better explaination available elsewhere, we <i>link</i> to it.</p>

		<h2>Conventions used in this document</h2>
		<p>Different sections are marked with an emoji according to the following categories:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>:gem: = best practice</li>
			<li>:green_apple: = convention</li>
			<li>:gift_heart: = helpful tool</li>
		</ul>

		<p>There's a significant difference between a <i>best practice</i> and a simple <i>convention</i>. <i>Best practices</i> are usually derived from experience and require some level of evidence to back them up. <i>Conventions</i> are often based on personal preference and are OK to break given some resonable argument.</p>
