## Cascading Style Sheets

### Conventions
CSS, LESS, or SCSS can be organized in many different ways. Therefore,
it's nice to find a review of guidelines implemented at a big company.

I found the official [Trello CSS Guide][guide] and thought they caputred
all the essentials of developing maintainable CSS code. Please look no
further. Stick to these general guidelines and worry less about picking
up any specific "front-end naming methodology".
